<p>Chef Two and Chef Ten are playing a game with a number X. In one turn, they can multiply X by 2. The goal of the game is to make X divisible by 10.</p>
<p>Help the Chefs find the smallest number of turns necessary to win the game (it may be possible to win in zero turns) or determine that it is impossible.</p>

<h3>Input:<br></h3>
<li>The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.</li>
<br><li>The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer denoting the initial value of X. </li>

<hr>
	
<h3>Output:<br></h3>
<p>For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the minimum required number of turns or −1 if there is no way to win the game.</p>
