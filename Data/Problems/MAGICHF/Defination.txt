<p>When Chef was visiting a fair in Byteland, he met a magician. The magician had N boxes (numbered 1 through N) and a gold coin. He challenged Chef to play a game with him; if Chef won the game, he could have the coin, but if he lost, the magician would kidnap Chef.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the game, the magician places the gold coin into the X-th box. Then, he performs S swaps. To win, Chef needs to correctly identify the position of the coin after all swaps.</p>
<p>In each swap, the magician chooses two boxes A and B, moves the contents of box A (before the swap) to box B and the contents of box B (before the swap) to box A.</p>

<h3>Input:<br></h3>
<p>The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.</p>
<p>The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, X and S.</p>
<p>S lines follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers A and B denoting a pair of swapped boxes.</p>

<hr>
	
<h3>Output:<br></h3>
<p>For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of the box containing the gold coin after all swaps are performed.</p>
